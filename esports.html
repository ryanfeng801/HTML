Esports (also known as eSports, e-sports, competitive (video) gaming, electronic sports, or pro-gaming in Korea) can be defined as a form of sports where the primary aspects of the sport are facilitated by electronic
systems; the input of players and teams as well as the output of the eSports system are mediated by human-computer interfaces.[1] Most commonly eSports take the form of organized multiplayer video game competitions,
particularly between professional players. The most common video game genres associated with esports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter (FPS), and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA).
Tournaments such as The International Dota 2 Championships, the League of Legends World Championship, the Battle.net World Championship Series, the Evolution Championship Series, the Intel Extreme Masters, provide
both live broadcasts of the competition, and prize money and salaries to competitors. </h3>
